# BLE-INDOOR-POSITIONING-SYSTEM
Hardware implementation of a low-cost BLE device monitoring and indoor localization system using ESP32. The project uses RSSI sensing with Kalman filtering, path-loss modeling, and Min-Max/Trilateration algorithms, plus a web interface for real-time device detection in restricted areas.

📌 Project Overview

This project presents a low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device monitoring and indoor localization system implemented using ESP32 microcontrollers. It is designed to detect, track, and visualize active BLE devices in restricted or sensitive indoor environments such as examination halls, laboratories, and secure zones.

The system passively monitors BLE advertising packets, processes unstable RSSI measurements using Kalman filtering, estimates distance via a log-distance path loss model, and localizes devices using Trilateration and Min-Max algorithms. A web-based interface provides real-time visualization of detected devices and their estimated positions.


🎯 Objectives

•Detect unauthorized BLE devices in restricted indoor areas
•Reduce RSSI fluctuations using lightweight filtering techniques
•Achieve accurate indoor localization using minimal hardware
•Compare localization performance of Trilateration and Min-Max methods
•Provide real-time monitoring through a web-based dashboard


🛠 Hardware Architecture

The system is built using four ESP32 microcontrollers:

✅ Anchor Nodes (3 × ESP32)
•Continuously scan for BLE advertisements
•Measure RSSI from nearby BLE devices
•Apply Kalman filtering for signal smoothing
•Estimate distance using calibrated path-loss parameters

✅ Server Node (1 × ESP32)
•Aggregates data from all anchors via ESP-NOW
•Executes localization algorithms
•Hosts a web server for visualization and user interaction
•All anchors are placed at known coordinates in a 5 m × 5 m indoor environment.


📡 Signal Processing & RSSI Filtering
•Raw RSSI values are highly unstable due to:
•Multipath propagation
•Human movement
•Signal shadowing and interference
•To overcome this, the project implements a Kalman Filter, which:
•Smooths noisy RSSI samples
•Outperforms standard moving average methods
•Provides stable distance estimates even in dynamic environments
•Kalman filtering significantly reduces distance estimation error, especially beyond 7 meters.

📐 Distance Estimation – Path Loss Model

•The system converts filtered RSSI values into distance using the Log-Distance Path Loss Model:
•Environmental parameters (A and n) are calibrated experimentally
•RSSI samples are collected at 1–5 meter intervals
•Calibration is performed individually for each anchor
•Provides environment-specific accuracy
•This calibration ensures reliable distance estimation in indoor conditions.

📍 Localization Algorithms
🔹 Trilateration

•Uses intersection of three distance-based circles
•Highly sensitive to RSSI and distance errors
•Performs well under Line-of-Sight (LOS) conditions
•Fails under noisy or NLOS environments

🔹 Min-Max Algorithm

•Uses bounding boxes instead of circle intersections
•Robust against distance estimation outliers
•Computationally efficient
•Provides stable localization in real-world conditions

📊 Result: Min-Max consistently outperformed Trilateration in noisy indoor environments.

🌐 Web-Based Visualization

•A web server hosted on the ESP32 server node provides:
•Automatic BLE device scanning
•Display of device names and MAC addresses
•User-selectable device tracking
•Real-time plotting of estimated position
•Distance and localization algorithm comparison
•Users can access the interface via a browser using the ESP32’s IP address.

🧪 Experimental Setup

•Environment: 5 m × 5 m indoor room
•Anchor placement: (0,0), (5,0), (0,5)
•Anchor height: 1.25 meters
•Tested under LOS and simulated noisy conditions
•Multiple trials conducted for validation

📊 Results & Key Findings

•Kalman filtering significantly stabilizes RSSI signals
•Distance estimation accuracy improves over standard averaging
•Trilateration suffers from large coordinate errors under noise
•Min-Max provides reliable localization even in harsh conditions
•System performs well using only four low-cost ESP32 devices
