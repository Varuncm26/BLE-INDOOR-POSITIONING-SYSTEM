# BLE-INDOOR-POSITIONING-SYSTEM
Hardware implementation of a low-cost BLE device monitoring and indoor localization system using ESP32. The project uses RSSI sensing with Kalman filtering, path-loss modeling, and Min-Max/Trilateration algorithms, plus a web interface for real-time device detection in restricted areas.
